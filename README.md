# sonify
Use basis function expansions to sonify 2D and 3D galaxy data

- currently not safe for human consumption - there's a lot of improvements needed but working example lives in 'Demo_notebook'

## Needed:
- figure out what is going on with the reconstruction (can we get rid of the artefacts in the center?)
- look at different mapping choices (instruments, what maps to what ((like do we want to map coefficient amplitude to volume? what do we do if we want to have n > 12?)), ordering of notes in the mapping....)
- advance to 3D!
    * Consider both star particles and dark matter - ask fun questions like what does a bar forming sound like in baryonic and in dark matter?
    * There will be more choices to make here on how to do the mapping
    * How do we condense the dimensions further to make it easier to hear differences?
