# sonify
Use basis function expansions to sonify 2D and 3D galaxy data

## disclaimer: currently undocumented and not quite ready for human consumption 

- Code used to sonify the Hubble Ultra Deep Field galaxies and N-body simulation (run in ChaNGa by Jason Hunt) as seen in [our mini documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k02yppf1iDo) is in the documentary directory
- Code developed leading up to the Edinburgh Science Festival is in the science festival directory
- Most up-to-date code is in the survey mapping directory. This directory contains code for each of the mappings used in our survey, [accessible here](https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/8363982/Sonification-Mapping-Testing). The data that we use are SDSS images from GalaxyZoo, downloaded from [here](https://data.galaxyzoo.org)
- Expansion code is based on [FLEX pipeline](https://github.com/ananyag8303/FLEX-pipeline) by Ananya Ganapathy and Mike Petersen

## Needed:
- add documentation
- clean up code
- advance to 3D!
    * Consider both star particles and dark matter - ask fun questions like what does a bar forming sound like in baryonic and in dark matter?
    * There will be more choices to make here on how to do the mapping
    * How do we condense the dimensions further to make it easier to hear differences?
