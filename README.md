# sonify
Use basis function expansions to sonify 2D and 3D galaxy data

- currently a work in progress, not quite ready for human consumption - there's a lot of improvements needed some working examples live in the notebooks in EdinburghScienceFestival2025/

## Needed:
- work out pixel artefacts
- determine stability of coefficients (how much changes if the same galaxy is rotated, for example?)
- look at different mapping choices (ex - instruments, incorporating volume, maybe different n and m orders, ordering of notes in the mapping)
- advance to 3D!
    * Consider both star particles and dark matter - ask fun questions like what does a bar forming sound like in baryonic and in dark matter?
    * There will be more choices to make here on how to do the mapping
    * How do we condense the dimensions further to make it easier to hear differences?
